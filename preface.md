# Preface

The rapidity toith which the first edition of these short biographies disappeared, and the many requests which have reached us for a new edition, are assurances that our people are taking more that a passing interest in the lives and sufferings of the Jesuit martyrs of early Canada. All the testimony in favor of their Beatification, given before the Apostolic Commission at Quebec during the past couple of years, has reached Rome, where it is being submitted to the scrutiny of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. It is the ardent prayer of the friends of those old heroes of the Cross that the verdict of that august tribunal shall be favorable to their Cause.

Meanwhile we are asked to make a deeper study of their lives, in order the better to know what manner of men they were, how intense were the sufferings they endured for the Faith, how great must have been the reward of their sacrifices, how absolute the confidence we should have in their power before the throne of God, and how signal the favors we may expecjt by appealing to their intercession.

May the day soon arrive when they shall enjoy the honors of the altar, and when, with the sanction of the Infallible Church, we may invoke them publicly: Blessed John de Br√©beuf and Companions, way for us .
